Welcome to my Bubble Sort and Merge Sort program!

With this program, you can make an array and sort it using Bubble Sort and Merge Sort.

After you have sorted an array by using both sorting methods, you can compare the two .txt files to see if they are equal or not.

Here are some instructions for my code:
Press 1 to generate an array of random integers and store it in a file.
Press 2 to read an existing file containing a list of integers, sort it with BubbleSort, and store the sorted array in another file.
Press 3 to read an existing file containing a list of integers, sort it with MergeSort, and store the sorted array in another file.
Press 4 to compare BubbleSort and MergeSort results.
Press 5 to exit the program.

Have fun sorting!
